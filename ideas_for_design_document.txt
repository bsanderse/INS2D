ideas for design document:

- no global variables, function instead of scripts (maybe with few exceptions)
- matrices mentioned in theory exist also in code
- Benjamin: maybe separate all BC values from V_h such that V_h is independent of BC types
- Henrik: y_M,y_A,y_I only depend on Dirichlet BC, y_G,y_D only depend on Neumann BC
          -> wrong: y_D depends on Dirichlet BC, composition y_O = nu*y_D-y_G in general not possible
    -> possibility to make boundary contribution terms dependent on V_h (at leat V_h^normal and V_h^tangential required!) 
- remove prefix in case files (e.g. actuator_unsteady_ROM_BCtype.m -> BCtype.m) -> simplifies copying case files
